# Module 1 Final Project

## Introduction

This is a Module 1 Final Project in Flatiron school Data Science program.

## Objectives

* To show basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) skills
* To find 3 questions and insights to them from EDA
* Present the information with understanable visuals to a non technical group

## The Project

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content, and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but the problem is they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. They have hired you to help them better understand the movie industry.
Your team is charged with doing data analysis and creating a presentation that explores what type of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the CEO can use when deciding what type of films they should be creating.

## The Dataset

Included in the repository (in the folder `zippedData`) is some movie-related data from:
* Box Office Mojo
* IMDB
* Rotten Tomatoes
* TheMovieDB.org

### Files

The main files used for this analysis is cleaned from:
* imdb.name.basics.csv
* tn.movie_budgets.csv

# The Deliverables

1. A well documented [**Jupyter Notebook**](https://github.com/timothywlim/dsc-mod-1-project-v2-1-online-ds-sp-000/blob/master/student.ipynb)
2. An organized [**README.md**](https://github.com/timothywlim/dsc-mod-1-project-v2-1-online-ds-sp-000/edit/master/README.md)
   ~This current file you're reading
3. A short [**Keynote/PowerPoint/Google Slides presentation**](https://github.com/timothywlim/dsc-mod-1-project-v2-1-online-ds-sp-000/blob/master/PresentionSlide.pdf) 
4. [**A Blog Post**](https://timothywlim.medium.com/baby-steps-in-exploratory-data-analysis-eda-with-python-ac6843b30f76)
5. [**A Video Walkthrough**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nYGXJSLJOQ)

# Process
The process can be break to following:
1. Reading/ inspecting all csv files
2. Creating hypothesis or questions for item of interest
3. Cleaning of data
4. Data Exploration
5. Data Visualization
6. Insights and Sumary


# Tools
Python, PANDAS, Matplotlib, Seaborn, datetime

# Summary
### Project Overview
We focus on 3 topics of interest: \
Movie Genre, Release Date, Budget\
Questions considered: \
1. What are the genre trends over the years? What are the genres combination should our client focus on making?
2. What is the best time to release movies?
3. How are the sales compared between domestic and worldwide?
4. What is the benchmark rate of return to target?
5. What are the forecast budget in a good movie? What are the risk?

### Project Future Work
1. We could find average budget break down by genre
2. Comparing budgets, earnings and number of released movies of competing movie producers could help to gage the market share
3. A more current datasets can be used to track recent movie streaming favorites

### Project Thoughts
This is a interesting project to get my feet wet in EDA using python. Coming from a background of analysing calculated data thorugh excel to this is overwhelming initially with the sheer ammount of information that one has to clean. If I have any advice for myself before starting the project would be: "Stay curious, be enthusiatic. Come up with a rough framework, focus through the walk, clean up and dig deeper as you go."
