# Module 1 Final Project

## Introduction

This is a Module 1 Final Project in Flatiron school Data Science program.

## Objectives

* To show basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) skills
* To find 3 questions and insights to them from EDA
* Present the information with understanable visuals to a non technical group

## The Project

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content, and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but the problem is they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. They have hired you to help them better understand the movie industry.
Your team is charged with doing data analysis and creating a presentation that explores what type of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the CEO can use when deciding what type of films they should be creating.

## The Dataset

Included in the repository (in the folder `zippedData`) is some movie-related data from:
* Box Office Mojo
* IMDB
* Rotten Tomatoes
* TheMovieDB.org

### Files

The main files used for this analysis is cleaned from:
* imdb.name.basics.csv
* tn.movie_budgets.csv
